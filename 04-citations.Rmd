# Footnotes and citations

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k} (\#eq:hola)
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
y^2 - z^2 &= 1 \\
+
(x + z &= 2)
\end{align}

$$x+z+y^2+z^2=3$$

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one [^04-citations-1].

[^04-citations-1]: This is a footnote.

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.

The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>
